Custom Header in Table
I added a new header to the table because the headers retrieved from the endpoint didnâ€™t fully match the keys in the data items that needed to be displayed. Due to these mismatches, some data was not showing up in the table.

To ensure that all data items are displayed correctly, I introduced a custom header with key_name values that align with the keys in the data items. This approach allows the table to render all available data accurately.
